Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications  
Importance; to develop software applications for improving quality , budget and time efficiency 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Change analysis
-Release planning 
-System implementation 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
2. Requirements and analysis
3. Design and prototyping
4. Coding
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model os a linear and subsequently approach where each phase must be compiled prior to moving on to the next step while Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer designs, programs, build, deployment and maintain software using many different skills and tools  
-A quality assurance engineer identifies defects and errors in the software contributing to the prevention of issues after the product is deployed.
-A project manager  helps in overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs helps programmers develop software code efficiently. Examples of IDEs are Eclipse and NetBeans.
-VCS enables the development teams to effectively manage and track changes to the codebase. Examples of VCS are Git and Bitbucket 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Time constraints
-Customers are not clear about their needs
-Rapid advancement of technology 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing is a type of testing tahy is conducted at the ground level. It is a low-level testing carried out to tets individual units or functions of the software under development.
-Integration testing verifies if the different modules or services used by your application work well together.
-Acceptance testing assesses if the product or application can handle real-world scenarios.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance is, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Example;How do I market online?
Improved-What are the key components of an effective digital marketing strategy for a startup in the e-commerce fashion industry?
The improved prompt is effective because the focus on a specific sector(e-commerce fashion industry) and a specific business stage(startup) provides guidance on how to frame the answers.
